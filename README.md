Current scripts
- Image to txt

Note, you can change the resolution in the code (default is 51:39)
- get corners (gets location of a four sided shape's individual blocks)
- loop coords (repeatedly prints out the coordinates of the mouse to the console)
(set the inputs for the RGB input fields as paint.txt, and you can format them as X,Y or the same format as the get corners script)
- auto paint (combines the output from image to text, get corners, and the manually inputted paint.txt)
